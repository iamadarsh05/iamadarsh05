Hello and welcome to my Github profile! My name is Adarsh, and I'm a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. with a passion for coding and web development. My technical skills include programming in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB, as well as proficiency in web technologies like HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. I've also gained experience working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. During my research internship at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, I worked on characterizing reindeer antlers, processing large datasets in MATLAB, and applying advanced techniques like Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for better data optimization. Outside of work, I love watching anime and enjoy meeting and talking to new people. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve, and my short-term goal is to secure a technical role where I can contribute and grow.
